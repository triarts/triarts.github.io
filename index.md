## Key Project

* #### ECG classification paper implementation
  * ###### Estimate duration: 3 months (during master thesis)

  * ###### Tools and Programming language: Tensorlfow, keras API, pyhton 3, jupyter notebook

  * ###### Description: This project is developed during writing my master thesis, which I implement other related works so that I can use them as a comparison to my proposed work. There are 2 papers that I implemented in this project. Both of them are for ECG signal classification, one is based on LSTM and the other one is based on CNN.

* #### Master thesis: Enhanced ECG SVEB Detection using EMD with Resampling based on LSTM

  * ###### Estimate duration: 4 months

  * ###### Tools and Programming language: Tensorlfow, keras API, pyhton 3, jupyter notebook

  * ###### Description: This project is my master thesis. In this project we classify arrhythmia into 5 classes based on AAMI standard, the goal is to improve one (SVEB class) of the classification performance result. By detecting SVEB it can help to assess if patients have a high possibility of developing Atrial Fibrillation in the future, SVEB also one of the reasons to trigger AF. By using EMD with resampling for preprocessing and use LSTM as classifiers we can achieve the highest classification performance in terms of SVEB class.

* #### Unity 2D mobile game development

  * ###### Estimate  duration: 2-3 weeks (during summer holiday)

  * ###### Description: In this project, I tried to develop a simple 2D game mobile game using Unity and publish it in google play store. This was done during the summer holiday in 2019, and this was the first time I'm start learning to use Unity. I am interested in developing a 2D game or mobile game that's the reason I decided to learn and create a project related to it.
